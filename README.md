# UnityDevelopment
testing out unity RPG creation

Week long project.


Scripts are in :
UnityDevelopment/2DTestProject/Assets/Scripts

Sprites are in:
UnityDevelopment/2DTestProject/Assets/Characters

Prefabs are in the Tiled2Unity folder at the moment
I'll add in what I'm using as maps later (maybe as images? Probably as .tmx files)
